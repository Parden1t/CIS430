        We are pleased to announce that the cocoa we use is harvested and
        shipped from Ecuador. Only the highest standards are accepted at
        chocolatina. The milk that is used for the chocolate is from Alpine cows
        and provides a smooth silky texture. This picture was taken at one of
        our own plantation sites in Ecuador.
